    "I feel confident that Descon remains on course to moving into the realm of becoming Pakistan’s leading engineering, chemicals and power conglomerate. Over the last three decades, we have maintained a leading position in a competitive regional market. This has been made possible by our entrepreneurial spirit, living up to commitments and relentless support of our stakeholders and understanding of global business trends. Our emergence as a leading engineering company is aligned with the vision of progressing up the value chain to add value for our customers. This evolution shall remain under focus during the coming years. For us, what matters most is customer satisfaction which we have to balance against our growth pattern. At the heart of all operations remain our team members who have the spirit to push boundaries and foster a culture of accepting challenges. Every organization needs to reinvent itself to meet changing market dynamics and we at Descon are going through the same phase. This will help reinforce us to be better prepared for the changing environment by re-examining all our current processes. In doing so, we look at the challenges that arise as opportunities to achieve continuous improvement. The growth of Descon’s business is predicated on safety and quality. We have embedded these principles in the DNA of our work force and reap the benefits by delivering high quality work for our customers without cutting any corners for the safety of our workforce and that of our clients.
